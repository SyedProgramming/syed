Recently I have volunteered a Data Science and Engineering Event where I was hosting the show, this gives me a lot of courage and I can interact with many people at the same time.
Got recognised by the manager and received a go beyond.

Management, Leadership and Effective Communication session had helped me a lot in my career perspective.
​
It has given me a new ability to adapt new communication style. Because different communication styles are the most frequently cited cause of poor communication. Every employee’s motivations are different, so knowing how to tailor your communication is essential to influencing others and reaching organisational goals.
This session has helped to become an essential leader, as one of the feature I have learned as when I need to talk and more importantly when I need to listen. So I can ask my colleagues opinions, ideas and feedback. And at the same time they do share actively engage in the conversation, pose questions, invite them to elaborate, and take notes.
It has helped me to be more transparent more like a senior manager by speaking openly about the company's goals, opportunities and challenges.
It has helped me to build trust amongst the team and foster an environment where employees feel empowered to share their ideas and collaborate.
My thoughts are strategic initiative, clear about what I want to see achieved by the end of each milestone.
​
​
I always use TED which stands for
"Tell me more."
"Explain what you mean."
"Define that term or concept for me."
​
I always ask feedback on me and try to implement the changes which I need to do it else I will be lossing the faith on my ability to follow through.
It's likely there will be comments I can't immediately act and I am always transparent about that.
​
​
My Organisation structure contains like I report to a Director --> Senior Director --> Vice President --> SVP --> EVP --> CEO.
​
This session has helped me to interact global team and talk about the Cross Technologies.
